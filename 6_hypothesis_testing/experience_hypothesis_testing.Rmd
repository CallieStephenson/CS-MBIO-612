Let's use the code provided below to generate a dataset representing two populations, each sampled from a Guassian with a specific population mean. Here I am generating only 5 samples

```{r}
set.seed(110)
data_1 = tibble(measure=rnorm(5, 10, 1))
data_1$site_name <- 'Site 1'
data_2 = tibble(measure=rnorm(5, 12, 1))
data_2$site_name <- 'Site 2'
complete_data = rbind(data_1, data_2)
complete_data
```

* I compute the mean of the dataset above using the following code:
  * feel free to deconstruct the code to see what each chunk does.

```{r}
mean(complete_data[complete_data$site_name == "Site 1", ]$measure)
mean(complete_data[complete_data$site_name == "Site 2", ]$measure)
```

* Use the `tapply` function instead of the code above to compute the means samples from "Site 1" and those from site 2
  * See tapply for help if needed.

```{r}
# Write your code here
tapply(complete_data$measure,complete_data$site_name,mean)
```

Q.2 

* Use the bootstrapping-procedure covered in class to assess whether there is a statistically significant difference between the data in `Site 1` and that in `Site 2`.

Make sure you follow the approach discussed in class and which consists of:

1. Selecting an appropriate test statistic
2. Bootstrapping a distribution for the observed statistic under the null hypothesis
3. Deciding whether to accept or reject the null based on the probability of the null
4. provide a p-value to support your decision.

```{r}
set.seed(110)
data_1 = tibble(measure=rnorm(40, 10, 1))
data_1$site_name <- 'Site 1'
data_2 = tibble(measure=rnorm(40, 13, 1))
data_2$site_name <- 'Site 2'
complete_data = rbind(data_1, data_2)
```


#### Q2.0 

Complete the following by describing the null and the alternative hypotheses we are testing here.

```{r}
### Write your answer here
#null hypothesis is that the two distributions are actually the same distribution
#alternative is that the two distributions are different
#we know because we built these distributions that the distributions are both normal with the same standard deviation but different means.
```

#### Q.2.1 

Produce a graph similar the one below (geom_density) display the distributions. If you're using the same seed as mine, your graph will look exactly the same as the one below 

![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rz5jxm84kk8ac1m/dist.png?dl=1)

```{r}
# write your code here
ggplot(complete_data, aes(x=measure, fill=site_name)) + 
  geom_density()+xlim(6,16)
```

Q2.2 Select a proper test statistic and produce a distribution of the statistic under the null hypothesis. Plot the data as both a histogram and density curves. Your graph may look like this.

![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3jarqg9swneai0r/mean_under_null.png?dl=1)

```{r}
# Write your code here
#I use the same code in the reading with some modifications to create a function that puts both datasets together, randomly splits them, and then subtracts the mean of one random data from the other
background_distribution_creator = function(x, y){
     x <- data_1$measure
     y <- data_2$measure
     concat_data = c(x, y)
     len_concat_data = length(concat_data)
     shuffled_data = sample(concat_data)
     new_data_1 = shuffled_data[1:40]
     new_data_2 = shuffled_data[41:len_concat_data]
     mean(new_data_1) - mean(new_data_2)}
mean_under_null = replicate(1000, background_distribution_creator(data_1, data_2))

ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(aes(mean_under_null, y=..density..), bins =30, alpha=0.2, color="black") + 
  geom_density(aes(mean_under_null), bw=0.2, size=1.5) + 
  xlim(-3, 3)
```

####  Q2.3. 

Calculate and plot the observed statistic on the graph you created in Q.2.2. 

```{r}
ggplot()+
    geom_histogram(aes(mean_under_null, y=..density..), bins =30, alpha=0.2, color="black") +
    geom_density(aes(mean_under_null), bw=0.2, size=1.5) + 
     xlim(-3, 3) +
     geom_point(aes(mean(data_1$measure)-mean(data_2$measure), 0), size=5, color = "red")

```
#### Q2.4 
#compute the p-vlaue of the observed statistic under the null. What do you conclude about the hypotheses you enunciated in Q
```{r}
t.test(data_1$measure, data_2$measure, )
#p is less than 0.05, so I would reject the null and say these are two different distributions
```
```

#### Q.3 

* The proportion of the of _P. lobata_, _M. capitata_ and _P. mendrina_ at a site X are c(0.60, 0.19, 0.21).
* You surveyed site Y with different environmental conditions and obtains the following proportions for the three corals (0.61, 0.19, 0.20). Use the multinomial non-parametric hypotheses test to assess whether the proportions obtained at sites X and Y are statistically different.


Although not explicitly required, your test should cover all the steps in Q2, i.e. appropriate graph(s) when possible, test statistics, and conclusion.

#Our null hypothesis is that the proportions at the sites are not statistically different
#Our alternative hypothesis is that the sites are statistically different
```

#### Q.3 
```{r}
#Our null hypothesis is that the proportions at the sites are not statistically different
#Our alternative hypothesis is that the sites are statistically different
species <- c('PLO', 'PLO', 'MCA', 'MCA', 'PME', 'PME')
ratio <- c(0.6, 0.61, 0.19, 0.19, 0.21, 0.20)
site <- c('x','y','x','y','x','y')
coral_data <- tibble(species, ratio, site)

subtract_abs = function(x){
    abs(x[1] - x[2])
}

observed_difference <- sum(tapply(coral_data$ratio, coral_data$species, subtract_abs))/2

building_multinorm_distribution=function(){
true_proportions = c(0.6, 0.19, 0.21)
sample_proportions = rmultinom(1, 200, prob=c(0.6, 0.19, 0.21))/200
sample_tvd = sum(abs(true_proportions- sample_proportions))/2
sample_tvd
 }
tvds = replicate(1000, building_multinorm_distribution())

ggplot()+ 
     geom_histogram(aes(tvds, ..density..), bins = 15) +
     geom_point(aes(observed_difference, 0), size=5, color="red")
```
```{r}
p_value = sum(tvds > observed_difference)  / length(tvds)
p_value
#p value is > 0.05 so we do not reject null
```
```
